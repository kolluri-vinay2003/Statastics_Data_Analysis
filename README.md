# My Statistics Notebook

I've organized it into two parts based on how statistics are used:
1. To describe and summarize data  
2. To draw conclusions and make predictions from data

## 1. Descriptive Statistics

This section helps me understand the structure and behavior of raw data before any deep analysis.

- **Measures of Central Tendency** – Mean, Median, Mode
- **Measures of Spread** – Range, Variance, Standard Deviation
- **Skewness** – To understand whether data is left or right skewed
- **Interquartile Range (IQR)** and **Coefficient of Variation (CV)** – To measure variability
- **Levels of Measurement** – Nominal, Ordinal, Interval, and Ratio scales  
  (Understanding this is essential before choosing charts or statistical methods)

## 2. Inferential Statistics

In this part, I focus on how we use samples to make predictions or decisions about a larger population.

- **Population vs Sample** – Knowing the difference between what we have and what we want to know
- **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** – The reason we can trust sample-based estimates
- **Confidence Intervals** – Estimating the range in which the true population mean is likely to fall

 It's a record of my own learning and progress.
